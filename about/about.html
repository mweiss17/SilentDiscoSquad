  <h3>What is Silent Disco Squad?</h3>
  <p>Silent Disco Squad uses mp3 players and smartphones to create a shared music experience, effectively transforming everyday moments into a silent disco danceparty.</p>
  <h3> How it Works</h3>
  <p>A dancemix is created and distributed prior to the event. Participants preload the mix to their music device. We all meet up together with our music devices and headphone and countdown "3, 2, 1, Play!" and the ritual begins. At the same time we all hit play,the mix will stream from SilentDiscoSquad.com's synchronized streaming service so those with smartphones + data plans do not have to download the mix ahead of time, and a shared music experience is created for those streaming and with mp3 players.</p>
  <h3>Inception</h3>
  <p>Inspired from his experiences on dancefloors David Zangwill decided to figure out how to take the power of the dancefloor into everyday moments- hence Silent Disco Squad. David's intention is to use the power of music to reduce the distance between self and other by Turning the World into a Dancefloor.
